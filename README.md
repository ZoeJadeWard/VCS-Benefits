# VCS-Benefits
Question 1 CM1705- Version Control Systems Benefits and Comparison 

Local Version Control systems- Being the first VCS (for example “Revision Control System”) to have been created it was a good starting point for developers to use as it opened doors for what was to come in the future, However, this System comes with its own set of problems in modern times, for a start this system could only be used on one computer, obviously as the world becomes a bigger place, more and more people are relying on applications and programs, teams of developers and programmers have developed into more than just 1 person on their own to a group of people working on projects together with business, working on a LVCS as part of a team this VCS as it was when created has become outdated and prehistoric. While this might be ideal for a very small business with only one developer/programmer working off one computer due to its free CDDL-licenced version as well as being tried and tested since its inception, I don’t feel it holds any benefits for any company replying on more then developer/programmer within their business as projects cannot be collaborated on by more than one member of staff (presuming that each person has their own computer), we also have to be aware that as this program is not on a shared database if something goes wrong as often does in an IT environment there is no way to retrieve data from a shared source.  

This is probably where the next Version control System comes into its own and benefits over a Local Version Control System.

Distributed Version Control Systems- as a descendent to the Local Version Control System, Distributed Version Control Systems (for example GIT), opens a world to much more cooperation within a business to have more developers/programmers in a team to work towards a common goal instead of in isolation (although if used a single user this still holds benefits over a Local Version Control Systems, like seamlessly controlling many files). A group of programmers being able to work on a single project at once allows a business to work to their proficiencies and create a program that is innovative and collaborative, making building of said programs to be more coherent. Another great benefit of this system is the way data is stored, unlike a LVCS, a DCVS allows changes being made a lot easier to follow as well because of its ability to track all changes made by any party working the program development, whether that is 1 developer or a group. Whilst still maintaining a readable file for any new developers/programmers coming into the business to pick on what has been done in the past and changes that have been made to files saved on the database.

In summary for any business looking to grow and keep up with a changing to more artificial intelligence-based world, with more jobs opening within the programming and development environments, the way forward would be to use Distributed Version Control Systems to pave the way for ease of use, reliability, and connectivity within the IT sector.
